		<p>This document provides best practices designed to improve publishing and using of data on the Web. As experience of publishing and using data on the Web grows there are further issues that need addressing to facilitate interaction between data publishers and data consumers. These best practices are developed to bridge the gap between them.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>In recent years, more and more structured and semi-structured data is moving onto the Web. The increasing interest on publishing open data together with social media and crowdsourcing applications motivates the growth of the volume of data available on the Web. On the one hand, data publishers aim to share data related to multitude domains, like transport, sciences, education, financial, cultural heritage and e-commerce. On the other hand, data consumers would like easy access to data that is accurate, regularly updated and guaranteed to be available at all times.</p>
		<p>A fundamental aspect about publishing and consuming data on the Web is having a common understanding between data publishers and data consumers. Without this agreement, data publisher efforts may be incompatible with data consumers desires. In order to achieve the full potential of having data on the Web, it is important to facilitate better communication between developers and publishers while contributing to develop the data on the Web ecosystem.</p>
		<p>Publishing data on the Web creates new challenges, like how to represent, describe and make data available on the Web in a way that it will be easy to find and to understand these data, while it is also possible to trust on them. In this context, it becomes crucial to provide guidance to publishers that will improve consistency in the way data is managed, thus promoting the re-use of data and also to foster trust in the data among developers, whatever technology they choose to use, increasing the potential for genuine innovation.</p>	
		<p>In this context, this document sets out a series of best practices mainly designed to bridge the gap between data publishers and data consumers. Best practices are organized around the different phases of the Data on the Web lifecycle, which provides a plan for considering the several tasks that will need to be performed on a data throughout its life on the Web. As proposed by [[REF]], data is a living thing that moves through various stages, such as creation, publishing, use or termination. Best practices can be seen as guidelines that help to manage the data on these different phases.</p>
		<p>Best practices cover different aspects related to data publishing and consuming, like data formats, data access, data identification and metadata. In order to delimit the scope and elicit the required features for Data on the Web Best Practices, the <acronym title="Data on the Web Best Practices">DWBP</acronym> working group compiled a set of use cases that represent scenarios of how data is commonly published on the Web and how it is used. The set of requirements derived from these use cases were used to guide the development of the DWBP.</p>
