    <p>This document provides best practices designed to improve
    publishing and using of data on the Web. As experience of
    publishing and using data on the Web grows there are further
    issues that need addressing to facilitate interaction between
    data publishers and data consumers. These best practices are
    developed to bridge the gap between them.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>In recent years, more and more structured and
    semi-structured data is moving onto the Web. The increasing
    interest on publishing open data together with social media and
    crowdsourcing applications motivates the growth of the volume
    of data available on the Web. On the one hand, data publishers
    aim to share data related to multitude domains, like transport,
    sciences, education, financial, cultural heritage and
    e-commerce. On the other hand, data consumers would like easy
    access to data that is accurate, regularly updated and
    guaranteed to be available at all times.</p>

    <p>A fundamental aspect about publishing and consuming data on
    the Web is having a common understanding between data
    publishers and data consumers. Without this agreement, data
    publishers efforts may be incompatible with data consumers
    desires. In order to achieve the full potential of having data
    on the Web, it is important to facilitate better communication
    between developers and publishers while contributing to develop
    the data on the Web ecosystem.</p>

    <p>Publishing data on the Web creates new challenges, like how
    to represent, describe and make data available on the Web in a
    way that it will be easy to find and to understand these data,
    while it is also possible to trust on them. In this context, it
    becomes crucial to provide guidance to publishers that will
    improve consistency in the way data is managed, thus promoting
    the re-use of data and also to foster trust in the data among
    developers, whatever technology they choose to use, increasing
    the potential for genuine innovation.</p>

    <p>This document sets out a series of best practices mainly
    designed to help to face the new challenges poses by data on
    the Web, while bridges the gap between data publishers and data
    consumers. These best practices are organized around the
    different phases of the Data on the Web lifecycle, which
    provides a plan for considering the several tasks that will
    need to be performed on a data throughout its life on the Web.
    As proposed by [[MOLLER]], data is a living thing that moves
    through various stages, such as creation, publishing, use or
    termination. Best practices can be seen as guidelines that help
    to manage the data on these different phases.</p>

    <p>Best practices cover different aspects related to data
    publishing and consuming, like data formats, data access, data
    identification and metadata. In order to delimit the scope and
    elicit the required features for Data on the Web Best
    Practices, the <acronym title=
    "Data on the Web Best Practices">DWBP</acronym> working group
    compiled a set of <a href="usecasesv1.html">use cases</a> that
    represent scenarios of how data is commonly published on the
    Web and how it is used. The set of requirements derived from
    these use cases were used to guide the development of the
    DWBP.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="audience" class="informative">
    <h2>Audience</h2>

    <p>This document provides guidance to those who publish data on
    the Web, but also to those who consume data on the Web. These
    best practices have been written to meet the needs of many
    different audiences from developers and information management
    staff to scientists interested on sharing data on the Web.
    Every attempt has been made to make the document as readable
    and usable as possible while still retaining the accuracy and
    clarity needed in a technical specification.</p>

    <p>Readers of this document are expected to be familiar with
    some fundamental concepts of the architecture of the Web
    [[WEBARCH]], such as resources and URIs, as well as open data
    formats [[REF]]. Basic knowledge about vocabularies and
    ontologies would be helpful to better understand some aspects
    of this document.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="scope" class="informative">
    <h2>Scope</h2>

    <p>As the goal of the document is to specify Best Practices for
    data on the Web, statements that are not unique to publishing
    or consuming data on the Web are not included. In particular,
    this specification provides best practices to encourage reuse
    or publication of data on the Web.<br>
    All best practices are written as testable criteria for
    objectively determining if they were correctly employed.
    Testing the best practices would involve a combination of
    automated testing and human evaluation.</p>

    <p>Lack of adherence to any given best practice, however, does
    not necessarily imply a lack of quality; they are
    recommendations that are said to be 'best' in most cases and in
    most contexts, but not all. A best practice is always subject
    to improvement as we learn and evolve the Web together.</p>

      <h2>Data on the Web Challenges</h2>

      <p>The openness and flexibility of the Web creates new
      challenges for data publishers and data consumers. Different
      from conventional databases, for example, where theres is a
      single data model to represent the data and a database
      management system (DBMS) to control data access, data on the
      Web implies to have several ways to represent and to access
      data. Besides, since data publishers and data consumers may
      not belong to the same company, it becomes essential to
      provide information about data quality and data provenance.
      In the same way, data licenses should also be explicitly
      informed. The table below summarizes some of the main
      challenges faced when publishing or consuming data on the
      Web. These challenges were identified from the DWBP Use Cases
      and Requirements and are described by one or more
      questions.</p>

    <section id="lifecycle">
      <h2>Data on the Web Lifecycle</h2>

      <p>Literature presentes a lot of proposals for data
      lifecycles ranging from multimedia data [[HARDMAN]] to
      digital libraries [[LIFECYC]]. In [[MOLLER]] is presented a
      survey of lifecycle models for data-centric domains as well
      as an Abstract Data Lifecycle Model (<acronym title=
      "Abstract Data Lifecycle Model">ADLM</acronym>) composed by a
      set of phases, features and roles, which can be used to
      classify and compare existing lifecycle models. ADLM also
      provides the basis to construct new lifecycle models for
      data-centric domains. According to [[MOLLER]] a generic
      lifecycle model for data-centric domains is composed by the
      following main phases: <em>Ontology development</em>,
      <em>Planning</em>, <em>Creation</em>, <em>Archiving</em>,
      <em>Refinement</em>, <em>Publication</em>, <em>Access</em>,
      <em>External use</em>, <em>Feedback</em> and
      <em>Termination</em>.</p>

      <p>The Data on the Web lifecycle used in this document is an
      instance of ADLM. In the following, the ADLM phases are
      revisited and defined according to the data on the Web
      context. It is important to note that the ontology
      development phase is not included, since it is considered an
      independent phase that can take place a priori.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><em>Planning</em>: this phase concerns the moment when
        the intent to publish data on the Web takes a concrete
        form. It also comprises the selection of data to be
        published</li>

        <li><em>Creation</em>: defines the moment when new data is
        created. It means that the data did not exist on the
        Web</li>

        <li><em>Archiving</em>: this phase concerns the process of
        anchoring a piece of data within the system by the means of
        indexing, cataloguing or a similar activity</li>

        <li><em>Refinement</em>: this phase covers all kinds of
        activities which make additions or changes to data that
        already exist in the Web</li>

        <li><em>Publication</em>: this phase concerns the moment
        when data is made accessible on the Web</li>

        <li><em>Access</em>: denotes the moment in the lifecycle
        when users gain access to the data available on the
        Web</li>

        <li><em>External</em> use: implies that the user performs
        some further actions to create visualizations and to
        perform data analysis, for example</li>

        <li><em>Feedback</em>: allows users to comment on the data
        or metadata available on the Web they have previously
        accessed and used</li>

        <li><em>Termination</em>: presents the moment when data is
        removed from the Web</li>
      </ul>

      <p>As proposed in [[MOLLER]], the data on the Web lifecycle
      model is an evolving one, since there is no restriction for
      data to pass through all phases of the lifecycle before the
      start of a new iteration, neither a specific point of the lifecyle to begin with.</p>

      <p>In the data on the Web context, two main roles may be
      played by actors in the lifecycle: data publisher and data
      consumer. The data publisher role may be played by several
      actors who are responsible for performing actions like data
      and metadata creation, and data publication and archiving.
      The data consumer are these actors who receive and consume
      the data.</p>

    <section id="terminology">
      <h2>Terminology</h2>

      <p>This section will present some scenarios of publishing and
      consuming data on the Web, which will be written based on the
      DWBP use cases document. The idea is to generalize some use
      cases and present scenarios that describe real situations
      faced by both data publishers and data consumers. The
      terminology adopted in this documented will be presented
      together with the scenarios description.</p>

        <h4>Data Preservation</h4>Data preservation is a well
        understood and commonly performed tasks for static and
        self-contained data. This commonly includes the following
        steps:

        <ul>
          <li>Ingest the data and assign a persistent identifier to
          it</li>

          <li>Ensure the data is correctly stored and prevent bit
          rot</li>

          <li>Provide access to the data and perform format
          translation if needed</li>
        </ul>The model most commonly referred to is <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Archival_Information_System">
        Open Archival Information System</a>. Many institutions
        taking care of digital preservation are implementing this
        model or some variant of it. Web pages can be preserved
        following the same strategies, considering a web site as a
        static data set that is self-contained and can be all
        snap-shoted and preserved at a fixed time. When it comes to
        Web data some new elements have to be taken into account,
        namely:

        <ul>
          <li>The persistent identifiers (IRI) used across the web
          are related to live data that can change</li>

          <li>The meaning of a resource is contextualized by the
          other resources it is linked to</li>

          <li>Documents fetched in HTML, RDF of JSON, for instance,
          are only one of the many possible serialisation of the
          data they represent</li>
        </ul>The two following sections tackle requirements for the
        digital archive and the data depositors of Web data.

        <h5>Digital trusted repositories</h5>{{BP | title =
        Maintain a list of resources | description = Archives
        should maintain a list of resources being described in the
        preserved datasets | why = Web data is about the
        description of resources identified with a IRI. It is to be
        expected that queries made by data consumers will resolve
        around finding a preserved description of a particular
        resource. | what = At ingestion time a Web data dataset
        dump is scanned for all the subject described. For RDF and
        JSON-LD, this corresponds to all the resources in the
        "subject" position of statements. | outcome = A list of
        resources per ingested dataset | implementation = . | test
        = . | evidence = . }} {{BP | title = Assess preservation
        coverage | description = Archives should assess the
        preservation coverage of a particular dataset prior to
        ingestion | why = A chunk of Web data is by definition
        dependent on the rest of the global graph. This global
        context influences the meaning of the description of the
        resources found in the dataset. Ideally, the preservation
        of a particular dataset would involve preserving all its
        context. That is the entire Web of Data. | what = At
        ingestion time an evaluation of the linkage of Web data
        dataset dump to already preserved resources is assessed.
        The presence of all the vocabularies and target resources
        in uses is sought in a set of digital archives taking care
        of preserving Web data. Datasets for which very few of the
        vocabularies used and/or resources pointed out are already
        preserved somewhere should be flagged as being at risk. |
        outcome = A evaluation of the preservation coverage for a
        given dataset | implementation = | test = | evidence = }}

        <h5>Depositors</h5>{{BP | title = Provide data using a
        recognized serialisation format | description = Data
        depositors should provide their data dump in a W3C standard
        serialisation | why = | what = | outcome = | implementation
        = | test = | evidence = }}
