      <p> The Dataset Usage Vocabulary (DUV) can illustrate how datasets are
        used by humans and machines as well as describe consumer feedback in the
        form of user experiences and citation references. Datasets as defined by
        DCAT are a collection of data, published or curated by a single agent,
        and available for access or download in one or more formats. From this
        perspective a dataset is representative of a logical container used to
        organize physical data. </p>
      <p>By specifying a number of foundational concepts used to collect dataset
        consumer feedback and experiences, APIs can be written to support
        collaboration across the web by structurally publishing consumer
        opinions and experiences, and provide a means for data consumers and
        producers advertise and search for published open dataset usage. </p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> This vocabulary is meant to fill a niche that helps standardize the
          way web published dataset usage be conveyed and shared. At this time
          is no clear standard way to describe dataset usage on the Web. Without
          a means to systematically describe dataset usage, searching and
          conveying techniques are application specific and discovery and
          collaboration across the Web is more difficult. This vocabulary also
          recommends and requires data publishers to provide a mechanism of
          receiving data usage from data consumers in the form of
          feedback,citation and data correction. </p>

      <h2>Audience</h2>
      <p>The DUV is intended for data producers and publishers interested in
        tracking, sharing, and persisting consumer dataset usage. It is also
        intended for collaborators who require an exchange medium to advertise
        and interactively convey dataset usage. </p>

    <section id="scope" class="informative">
      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p> The scope of DUV is defined by the Data on the Web Best Practices
        (DWBP) Use Case document based on the data usage requirements about
        datasets. These requirements include: citing data on the Web, tracking
        the usage of data, sharing feedback and rating data. These requirements
        were derived from fourteen real world use cases examples provided in the
        use case document. </p>
